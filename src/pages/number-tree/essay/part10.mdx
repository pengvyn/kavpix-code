# **What is the Logic Tree?**

This is a continuation of the previous sections, if you haven't already, you can read from the [start](https://code.kavpix.com/number-tree/essay/page1)
<br/>
You can try out this logic tree [here](https://code.kavpix.com/logic-tree)!
<br/>
It looks very similar to the the number tree, but it uses logic gates instead.
<br/>
They both do pretty much the same thing, just not in the same contexts. So, the code and general processes are all similar, with only a few minor differences here and there.

# **Differences**

None of the major functions changed much. They just use different symbols and inputs. For the logic tree, I decided to skip the simplifier. It is important, but not completely necessary. Still, I plan to add it in some time in the future.

<br/>

With the number tree, the parser just had to check for single symbols. But now, it has to check for multiple. For example, `~&` (`Nand`) uses two characters: `~` and `&`.
Which means, we can't just go about it character by character, we need to first make sure that we combine the symbols together.

<br/>

You might remember the `joinSimilars` function from the number tree. We're just going to change that a bit to make sure it joins the operators together.

```typescript
const gateNames = ["~", "&", "|", "~&", "~|", "!=", "true", "false"];

function prepareGateString(gate: string, names: string[]): string[] {
    const listed = gate.split("")
    
    // joining
    let waiting: string = "";
    let prepared: string[] = [];

    for (const idx in listed) {
        if (listed[idx] === " ") {
            
            if(waiting !== "") {
                prepared = [...prepared, waiting];
            }

            waiting = "";

        } else if (listed[idx] === "(" || listed[idx] === ")") {
            prepared = [...prepared, ...(waiting === "" ? [] : [waiting]), listed[idx]];
            waiting = "";

        } else if (JSON.parse(idx) === listed.length - 1) {
            prepared = [...prepared, ...(waiting === "" ? [] : [waiting]), listed[idx]];

        } else if (waiting === "~") {
            if(listed[idx] === "&" || listed[idx] === "|") {
                waiting = waiting + listed[idx];
            } else {
                prepared = [...prepared, waiting, listed[idx]];
                waiting = "";
            }
        } else {
            waiting = waiting + listed[idx];

        }
    }

    return prepared;
}
```

It looks a little complicated, so let's go line by line.

First, the input string can be split to make a list. You can see that there is a `waiting` here as well.
<br/>
This one's a bit different, though. It stores just a string. For symbols like `~&`, it will store `~`,
then add `&` to it after.
<br/>
Then there's also a `prepared`. This one has the same function as `parsed` in the parser. It just stores the result-in-progress.
<br/>
This one uses a `for` loop. Let's start with the first `if`.

```typescript
if (listed[idx] === " ") {
            
            if(waiting !== "") {
                prepared = [...prepared, waiting];
            }

            waiting = "";

        }
```

For this one, we're using `" "` (space) as a separator. Whenever theres a space, it adds the waiting to the prepared list. Then, it resets the waiting.
<br/>
Next, open parentheses and closed parentheses. 


```typescript

else if (listed[idx] === "(" || listed[idx] === ")") {
    prepared = [...prepared, ...(waiting === "" ? [] : [waiting]), listed[idx]];
    waiting = "";

}

```

This one does pretty much the same thing.
<br/>
It adds the waiting to the prepared, but also the open/closed parentheses. If the waiting is empty, 
it just puts the parentheses in there. It resets the waiting as well, just like before.

```typescript

else if (JSON.parse(idx) === listed.length - 1) {
    prepared = [...prepared, ...(waiting === "" ? [] : [waiting]), listed[idx]];
}

```

This is to check if it's on the last value of the list. If it is, puts the waiting and the value into the prepared list.
<br/>
This step is needed because otherwise, the value would be added to the waiting, and the loop would end without the value.

```typescript

else if (waiting === "~") {
    if(listed[idx] === "&" || listed[idx] === "|") {
        waiting = waiting + listed[idx];
    } else {
        prepared = [...prepared, waiting, listed[idx]];
        waiting = "";
    }
}

```

This is for the `~`. It could either be a `not`, or it could be the start of a `nand` or `nor`.
<br/>
This one actually checks if `waiting` is `~`, not the current value. If the waiting is `~`,
it either adds the current value to `~` if the value is `&` or `|`.
<br/> Otherwise, it just adds the waiting and current value to the prepared and then resets the waiting.

```typescript

else {
    waiting = waiting + listed[idx];
}

```

It comes here whenever the current value is a gate (except for when the `waiting` is `~`), variable, boolean, or binary.
<br/>
Finally, it just returns `prepared`.
<br/>
That's pretty much the only change. The other major functions (parser, orderer, evaluator) all do the same thing as with the number tree, but they use logic gates instead.
