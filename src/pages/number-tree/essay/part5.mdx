# **Code**

This section just shows some snippets of the code I wrote, if you want to see the full project (or more), itâ€™s open-source [on github](https://github.com/pengvyn/kavpix-code). All of this code is written in TypeScript, with the help of a [few libraries](#libraries).

There are 4 main modules we need to write for this:

1. Parser. It takes the input you type and transforms it into a tree
2. Orderer. Re-arranges the tree to follow the order of operations
3. Evaluator. Takes a tree as input and evaluates/solves it as much as it can.
4. Simplifier. Evaluates the expression even further (more on this later)
