- done?: Elaborate on "calculation" just before #four-modules
- DONE: Talk about operation precedence in none-code section
  - With visualizations and things
- TODO: Talk about the motivation for making this thing
  - (Learning about math proofs, so doing this for something basic like number expressions is good for understanding)
- done: Change #for-loop title.

###### POWER SETS
